Comparison with Harmonic, LSCM, and Ricci, please check files under Gu_ICCV07 and Zeng_ECCV08

Comprison with Gu_ICCV03 only finished genus one case, for high genus case, I am still coding, reimplementing his method.

I will do comparison with the other two non conformal based methods tomorrow (thanks to the code available on web)  

Yin Xiaotian has not finished his Yamabe part. I will push him hurry.
